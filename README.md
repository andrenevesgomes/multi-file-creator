## Overview

The **Multi-File Creator Extension** is a handy tool for Visual Studio Code that enables you to quickly create multiple files at once by entering a comma-separated list of filenames. This extension is perfect for developers who frequently need to set up multiple files (e.g., configuration files, boilerplate code, etc.) in a new project, streamlining your workflow and reducing repetitive tasks.

## Features

- **Quick File Creation:**
  Create multiple files simultaneously by simply entering their names separated by commas (e.g., `main.bicep, secret.bicep`).

- **Customizable Hotkey:**
  Launch the file creation command using the default hotkey `Ctrl+Alt+N` (or customize it as needed).

- **Seamless Integration:**
  Use the command palette or your hotkey to instantly generate files in your active workspace.

- **Minimal Setup:**
  No complex configuration requiredâ€”just install and use.
